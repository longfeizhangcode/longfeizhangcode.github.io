The Purpose in Life test (PIL) is the best-known measure of meaning in life and has attracted widespread attention for decades. The current study aimed to determine the optimal version of the PIL and to investigate its psychometric properties in the Chinese context. This study was conducted with a Chinese college student sample (N = 986) using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and item response theory (IRT). The results indicated that Morgan and Farsides’ two-factor solution (PIL-10) showed the best fit to the data among all fifteen PIL versions. In addition, the PIL-10 was demonstrated to be a cross-culturally sound measure with good reliability and validity and has high precision over most of the latent trait range. However, the findings from category response curves showed some problematic options in some items. These findings may serve as references for revision of the PIL-10.
